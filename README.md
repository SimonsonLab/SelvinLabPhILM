PhILM, a.k.a., gSHRImP code.

This code can be used to create super-resolution images from movies of fluorophores that undergo transitions between bright and dark states (photobleaching, blinking, photoswitching, etc.), even when point spread functions from many fluorophores overlap.  For more details, see https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3212641/.
